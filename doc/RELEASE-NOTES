====22-Dec-1996=====Shareware again============================================
1.56

Previous versions have been sold commercially by Maxon GmhH.
They haven't reported any sales in years, so it's back to
the shareware concept.

If you bought a copy from Maxon, consider this a free update.

Features added, most notably:
    - does high density floppies
    - has some GUI helper programs

    For more changes/bug fixes see the file doc/Versions.

====06-Oct-1991=====This is offered to MAXON for commercial distribution=======
1.46
Features added:
    - Character conversions for PC files (NAME;A) and ST files (NAME;B)
    - Requesters added for confirmation of MSH::F actions
    - MSH:M+/- added to switch the requesters on and off

Bugs fixed:
    - Tracks with sectors numbered 0 crashed the device
    - Assigns did always refer to the rootdir

====27-Jun-1991=====This is offered to MAXON for commercial distribution=======

Changes:
    - The compiler used is now DICE, by Matt Dillon. This results in a
      smaller executable.

Features added:
    - Now accepts Atari ST bootblocks, and can use default values in case
      of nonsensical bootblocks.

====03-Mar-1991=====This is offered to MAXON for commercial distribution=======

Features added:
    - Dates of directories are updated when files or directories are
      created, renamed or deleted.
    - .INF -> .info, for Workbench users.
    - Creation date added in volume label. The normal date is the
      modification date.
    - device: checks for 2.0 and then uses TD_RAWWRITE
    - When using really large caches searching it is speeded up

Bugs fixed:
    - MSH: extending subdirectories forgot to clear the blocks first.

====05-Jun-1990=====From patch #3==============================================

Bug fixed:
    - device: The IBM disk format seems to have an index mark $5224/$5552
      before the first sector, even though the machines I tested it with
      did not seem to miss it.

Inconvenience removed:
    - MSH: no longer produces read error requestors when the bootblock of a
      newly inserted disk cannot be read. The disk is silently ignored.

Feature added:
    - MSH: is now more polite to some DFx: that uses the same physical
      drive.

Misc:
    - Reduced stack size of messydisk.device task (2K -> 1K) and of the
      filesystem itself (4K -> 3K). Xoper shows that (most of the time)
      no more than half of these stacks seems to be used.

====05-May-1990=====About patch #2a-2c=========================================

There have been many 'patch 2' versions. Therefore, I bumped the
version number after I cleaned up the distribution, so that a consistent
version number is possible.

====11-Mar-1990=====From patch #1==============================================

    This is patch #1 to MSH release #1. It consists of all binaries and
documentation. There are replacement source files, and a patch file for the
others.

Bugs fixed:
    - device: I/O could be done during CloseDevice(). Trackdisk does not
      seem to do this, and was implemented incorrectly anyhow.
    - handler: Examine() of the root directory got a . afther the 8th
      character of the volume name

Inconvenience removed:
    - handler: The AmigaDOS 1.3 List and Dir commands thought that all
      files were directories.

Features added:
    - handler: Now uses the Reserved entry in the Mountlist. You should
      normally set this to 0.
    - MSH::F+ and MSH::F-.
    - messyfmt: You can now write just the bootblock. The disk must
      already be formatted.
    - device: you can now, with some care, format disks with less than 8
      sectors per track.

====11-Feb-1990=====From release #1============================================

    This is the first really public release of the MessyFileSystem, or MSH
for short. It has circulated among a small audience, and I entered it in a
programming contest held by the German 'Amiga-Magazin'. They were too dumb
to let me win or offer me a contract, so here goes their opportunity to
make some money. Not mine, however, since I am going to try the sh*r*ware
concept. So, if you like the program, feel free to send me some $$, or even
$$$ if you feel like it.

    What _is_ MSH ? Well, if you ever heard of CrossDos, it is about the
same thing. Only better, since I wrote it :-) If you never heard of
CrossDos: MSH is a (set of) programs that enable you to use IBM-PC
diskettes in your Amiga, just as if they were regular Amiga disks.
Something you probably thought or were told to be impossible!

    There exist other programs that will copy files to and/or from messy
disks, but they do just that: copy. You are not able to use any other
program directly with files you have stored on a messy disk. But, with MSH,
this is finally possible. It seems that several people at about the same
time decided that it was time to write a program like MSH. Hence there is
also CrossDos. The fundamental difference between MSH and CrossDos is that
you immediately get a fully functional version of MSH, and you even get the
source! (And I am a non-commercial hobbyist).

    Of course, if you get the source, you won't get any warranty. The idea
is that if it works, you send me some $$ (preferably in some stronger
currency than the dollar, though); if it fails to work, you can fix it
yourself.
