There are two issues here -- the low-level format and the file system
format. An Amiga can read IBM disks because it can be programmed to
handle both of these. An IBM can't read an Amiga disk because the
generic PC floppy controller can't read the Amiga's low-level format.

Which is the same reason the Amiga gets more data on a disk. A PC
reads and writes individual sectors on a disk individually. Since
there's some slop in the positioning of the heads when this is done,
it's standard practice to leave some space between sectors. The
standard PC disk format puts 9 sectors on each track in 1MB mode, 18
sectors on each track in 2MB mode.  The Amiga always reads and writes
full tracks. So while it can deal with physically sectored disks like
those of the PC, the native Amiga format uses logical sectors; there's
no gap between sectors. This allows the Amiga to format 11 sectors per
track in 1MB mode, 22 sectors per track in 2MB mode (using the slow
drive, since the Paula chip itself can't handle HD data rates).

The Mac "high density" mode, first implemented in one of the Mac IIs
(I forget just when that appeared), dispensed with the old Mac floppy
controller. The old Mac floppy controller, used in the 68000-based
Macs, managed to store 800K per disk by varying disk speed. It still
used physical sectors, but since the linear density on a disk's outer
tracks is less at a constant angular velocity than on the inner
tracks, you can fit more on a disk by approximating a constant linear
velocity. Only CD's really use a constant linear velocity, since
real sectors are much more efficient. But many computers have done
this kind of thing in the past, including the PET and C64/C128 drives
(though they electronically varied the bit density, rather than
mechanically varying the angular velocity of the disk).  It's pretty
common on hard disk drives too -- if you're using a modern drive,
"track", "head", and "sector" numbers are just supplied to make you
comfortable; all modern PC drives are intelligent, and deal with sector
addresses independent of physical form.

Anyway, Apple got rid of that entirely on their high-density
format. At the low level, it's compatible with the PClone format,
though of course you need a Mac file system running on the PC (or
Amiga with HD disk drive) to read the HD Mac format.
