Msh		An Amiga file system handler that handles MSDOS formatted
		diskettes.  Version "1.58".  You can use files on such
		disks in almost exactly the same way as you use files on
		native AmigaDOS disks.	This is a fully functional,
		read/write version, that supports 8-10 (DD) or 16-21
		(HD) sector disks of 80 tracks, and should also work on
		40 track drives and hard disks with 12 or 16 bit VFAT of
		any dimension the FAT allows. That means: long filenames
		work now! Update to version "1.56".
		Includes source.  Author:  Olaf Seibert
