Reminder:
    If you like the program, feel free to send me some $$, or even $$$ if
    you feel like it. Please don't send any cheques not written in Dutch
    guilders (standard abbreviation: nlg or hfl), since they cost a lot of
    money (at least nlg 12.50; more than US$ 7) to cash.

    All shareware resellers (and especially those in Germany) are reminded

    than Fred Fish does. Those resellers do NOT have a licence to use or
    copy MSH. Also, if you distribute MSH:, you must distribute it in its
    entirety: you are not allowed to leave parts out. This also includes

1.5     release 1
1.30    release 1 patch 3
1.31    release 1 patch 3a
        Turn *.INF into *.info (for Workbench icons)
1.32    prepare for syslog

From here on everything may be #ifndeffed NONCOMM

1.33    MSH: fix directory extension bug
        [directories that were extended were not cleared first]
1.34    device: use TD_RAWWRITE when appropriate [if you have >= 2.04]
1.35    MSH: improved caching by separate sorted list
1.40    Offered to MAXON for commercial distribution (MAXON1)
1.41    Fixed bug in MSSetProtect that changed everything into plain files
        [protect msh:dir turned msh:dir into a file]
1.42    Cache bug and DICE conversion
1.43    Fix bug with assigns (hanlock.c); Change to newer syslog stuff.
        [assign x: msh:some/file worked as if it was assign x: msh:]
1.44    Fix bug that sectors numbered 0 crashed the device
        [usually doesn't occur - except with a certain sampler]
1.45    Add in-situ character conversions; ::-confirmation requesters
        [conversion of letters with umlaut and ß]
1.46    Freeze for MAXON (MAXON2)
1.47    Device: only set WORDSYNC on read, reload Custom in intr code
1.48    messyfmt: ASK, QUICK, BOOT; hanconv: swap pc/st condes for ss.
        [messyfmt get more user-friendly]
1.49    messyfmt: now suggests a reasonable FAT size
1.50    date.c: new function for date-to-days conversion
1.51    hanmain.c: removed InitCacheList() from MSDiskInserted(); ARGH!
	    Moved prototypes around (makeproto introduced);
	    Add const and __shared qualifiers for pure code;
	    No more DosType=1 but Interleave=65536;
	    Fixed superfluous uninhibits (Workbench caused problems);
        Device: changed cyl+side units into track units.
        (MAXON3)
1.52    hanmain.c, device2.c: Version string now contains \0$VER:
        date.c: was too conservative - didn't believe in leap days and others
        device2.c: fix off-by-one bug checking valid command number
        hanlock.c: handling of parentdir via MSParentDir()
1.53    hanconv.c: idiotic typo in initialisation of ToPc/ToST tables
        han2.c: incorporated and now works.
        hancmd.c/hanfile.c: default conversion settable.
        hanmain.c: expose private parts if asked politely.
        loadconv.c: created, as are makeconv.rexx, makepc.rexx, makest.rexx.
	    Its file format just happens to be identical to that of
	    CrossDos... purely by accident of course.
        device: add TD_EJECT, TD_GETGEOMETRY; bump ver/rev to 37.13.
        hanfile.c: OFFSET_END seeks were done in the wrong direction ARGH!
            Protect seek pos from being past EOF (due to SetFileSize).
            Count free clusters instead of free sectors.
        new: setmain.c/setwind.c, fmtmain.c/fmtwind.c.
        (MAXON4)
1.54    devio2.c: split read and write functions; always use RAWREAD/RAWWRITE
        under 2.04+.
        hanfile.c: MSCreateDir gave you an exclusive lock contrary to our
            liberal policy.
        hansec.c: try heuristics for the cache.
        fmtmain.c: changing SPT,NSIDES,NCYLS didn't update SPF.
        device1.a,device2.c: switch to RTF_AUTOINIT, saves a few bytes.
        New version of DICE: 2.07.54R. New version of RCS: 5.6 (hwgrcs).
        ignore.c: return 5 if errors are ignored, 10 if error occurs.
        Makefiles: added -mi (inline library calls)
1.55    Add compile option (LONGNAMES) for modified file system with
            long and mixed case filenames. Note that this is NOT compatible
	    with either normal FAT or Losedows-95 VFAT systems! It is an
	    entirely private format.
        hanfile.c: Fix MSWrite() to check disk full conditions in advance.
	     Optionally, update time of file on creation only.
        device: add support for HD floppies.
        han2.c: implement ACTION_FORMAT. As a side effect, more use is made
            of the mountlist info (as default layout and for format); the
            spt is updated as the disk format changes (for DiskCopy).
        msh-set/msh-format: use GadToolsBox 2.0C and be font-sensitive.
        hanfile.c: (optional) record creation time only, not modification.
        device: do units 4..11, and IO flags at open time
        pack.c: Use DOS 2.04+ calls to add/remove volume node.
            Fix ACT_SAME_LOCK - the AmigaDOS manual was wrong again wrt
            the results. This fixes wb: it will open drawers now.
        (MAXON5)
1.56*
        pack.c: set disk type to 'BUSY' when inhibited. (cf. Guru book)
            Fixed superfluous uninhibits better (no spurious DiskChange()
            calls anymore).
        hansec.c: check BPB values more strictly to avoid divide by 0.
	    MSUpdate(): Don't write FAT twice when writing low->high.
	    ReadBootBlock() Cancel would be left set when no disk
            is inserted. This caused disk change detection to fail.
        Small adaptations for DICE 3.0. Add BeginIO() stub because DICE's
            one is wrong for register arguments.
        Eliminate most #ifdefs (replaced by #if)
        devio2.c: Additionally, CMD_Write had a bug where an expression
            like (a <= b || c = d) was not recognised by DICE as incorrect.
            The code generated was for ((a <= b), d).
            This bug has been here since 1.53->1.54 (thanks for RCS!).
            This also caused disk change detection to fail.
        most files: removed register from declarations.
	hanlock.c: make MSSetProtect() return DOSTRUE.
	hanfile.c: MSWrite(): always mark MSFileLock as dirty when writing
	    to the file, not just when !CREATIONDATE_ONLY.

TODO:

-	Sometimes does not write out a last update until the disk is
	ejected, then it demands the disk back.
-	Seems not to work with DynamiCache.
-	Still some race conditions when you attempt an operation while
	the disk is still being inserted or has just been inserted but
	not identified yet.
-	BeOS formatted diskettes somehow still manage to crash MSH.
