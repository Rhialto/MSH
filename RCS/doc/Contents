Msh		An Amiga file system handler that handles MSDOS formatted
		diskettes.  Version "1.30" (Release 1 patch 3).  You can
		use files on such disks in almost exactly the same way as
		you use files on native AmigaDOS disks.  This is a fully
		functional, read/write version, that supports 8, 9, or 10
		sector disks of 80 tracks, and should also work on 40 track
		drives and hard disks with 12 or 16 bit FAT of any
		dimension the FAT allows.  Update to version "1.5" (Release
		1) on disk 327.  Includes source.
