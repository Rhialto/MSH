Msh		An Amiga file system handler that handles MSDOS formatted
		diskettes.  Version "1.56".  You can use files on such
		disks in almost exactly the same way as you use files on
		native AmigaDOS disks.  This is a fully functional,
		read/write version, that supports 8-10 (DD) or 16-21
		(HD) sector disks of 80 tracks, and should also work on
		40 track drives and hard disks with 12 or 16 bit FAT of
		any dimension the FAT allows.  Update to version "1.30"
		on disk 382.  Includes source.  Author:  Olaf Seibert
